# Hybrid Content Boosted Neural Collaborative Filtering for Automatic Playlist Genration

This repository is team **spotif.ai**'s main repository of the solution for the [Spotify-RecSys2018 Challenge](https://recsys-challenge.spotify.com/overview). The proposed system is a hybrid recommender system that employs the content of the playlist and the Collaborative Filtering (CF). More speicifically, we use two different recommenders for the two different recommendation scenarios.  

1. Matrix Factorization (MF) based CF model  
  - If seed tracks are already existing, one can deploy well-developed (any kind of) MF based CF system for the recommendatation.  

2. Content Based Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)  
  - 

## Try out the system
- TBD


## TODOs
- [x] ~generate readme~
- [ ] provide a script (or notebook) for quick run of the program
