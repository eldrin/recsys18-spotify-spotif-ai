## TODO:

* low-confidence subset WRMF reranking performance (@macbook)
* get attention FC net with 500k subset (@246)
* get text RNN net with 500k subset (@28)
* test different weight setting for `WRMF`
  * explicit setting for main interaction (playlist-item)
  * implicit setting for artist interaction (artist-playlist)
* try different `WRMF` base model implementation (i.e. [**implicit**](https://github.com/benfred/implicit)
